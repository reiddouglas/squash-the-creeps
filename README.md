My copy of the [Squash the Creeps](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-3d-dodge-the-creeps) project after following the Godot [Your first 3D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html) tutorial.

You can download and play the executable by going to the releases in this repository.
